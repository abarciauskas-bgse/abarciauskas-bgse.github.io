When not climbing or computing, I enjoy watching [IFSC (International Federation of Sports Climbing)](http://www.ifsc-climbing.org/) World Cup Competitions.

These days, the Japanese team :japan: dominates IFSC bouldering competitions. It is not uncommon for half the bouldering field to be Japanese. 

I wanted to know if this single-nation dominance was a new phenomenom. I "gathered" some data from the IFSC website and found 12 Japanese competitors made the semifinals in 2007, compared with 69 in 2017.

Of course, space in the semifinals is limited. The number of French competitors :france: making the semifinals during the same period has declined from 75 in 2007 to 23 in 2017.

The countries listed above are the most represented 10 countries in IFSC bouldering semifinals the from 2007-2017. 79.5% of bouldering semifinalists are from these 10 countries.
