This project was done in collaboration with researchers at <a href="https://www.bsc.es/" target="_blank" rel="external">Barcelona Supercomputing Center</a> and I was advised by <a href="http://monica-marrero.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Mónica Marrero</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Inspired"><a href="#Inspired" class="headerlink" title="Inspired"></a>Inspired</h2><p><strong>This project was hugely inspiring to helping define goals I want to achieve personally. Specifically, I wish to pursue work facilitating access to social goods and services. I feel access to information about influential financial or government agencies operate is an important social good.</strong></p>
<p>Another word for this is transparency, but the inaccessibility of this information due to its size and vocabulary is often a barrier to wider understanding.</p>
<p>The project’s objective was to surface redundancies in <a href="https://w33.bcn.cat/GasetaMunicipal/Inici?lang=EN" target="_blank" rel="external">Barcelona’s Municipal Gazette</a>. I conducted a <a href="http://abarciauskas-bgse.github.io/2016/04/28/Measuring-Redundancy-in-Text-Corpora-An-Overview-of-Current-Methods/">literature review</a> and estimated redundancies using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm" target="_blank" rel="external">Needleman-Wunsch sequence alignment</a> and the human intelligence platform <a href="http://crowdcrafting.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">crowdcrafting</a>.</p>
<p>The Needleman-Wunsch methodology was successful at surfacing redundancies in the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). I omit details of the initial methodology here and refer interested readers to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rzoNReQiMYcOv1RbBjW7Zw9pRBpvxmaO4VE1Lhe3oiI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>the final submission (report, slides and short video) in this Google Drive folder.</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="Ongoing-investigation"><a href="#Ongoing-investigation" class="headerlink" title="Ongoing investigation"></a>Ongoing investigation</h2><p>I have been delaying a post about this project as I was revisiting the secondary methodology employed: I wanted to find more granular ideas and topics using word-based similarity measures such as cosine similarity or clustering based on tf-idf scores. I have tried graph clustering, k-means, EM algorithm, and spectral clustering methods. So far I have had limited success due to either computational constraints or the found clusters not being particularly illuminative.</p>
<p>The greatest success I have found is with <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=DBBBC032EF52C6F9B0E5DF0F390B68DC?doi=10.1.1.135.1608&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">spectral biclustering</a>. Spectral biclustering (and coclustering) find clusters which are defined by both a subset of documents and words from the original corpora. Biclustering successfully discovered a few clusters of highly redundant documents, e.g. numerous instances of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a cluster which contained details of the housing market:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The housing downturn deepened as sales of new and existing single-family homes continued to fall.</p>
<p>In the household sector, the rise in home mortgage debt likely slowed a bit further in the first quarter, as home-price appreciation appeared to have remained sluggish.</p>
<p>The monthly readings on sales of new and existing homes through May had fluctuated around levels lower than the average over the second half of 2006.</p>
<p>In light of the recent economic data and anecdotal information, the Committee agreed that the statement to be released after the meeting should note that economic indicators had been mixed, that the adjustment in the housing market was ongoing, and that the economy seemed likely to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Work-in-progress-and-Next-Steps"><a href="#Work-in-progress-and-Next-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Work in progress and Next Steps"></a>Work in progress and Next Steps</h2><p>This is still a work in progress, as I am still working out systematic ways to:</p>
<ul>
<li>return helpful results,</li>
<li>estimate the quality of the overall cluster sizes (e.g. how to choose the number of document and term clusters), and,</li>
<li>determine the quality of individual clusters.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think there is good intuition behind document and word co-clustering, but I am not yet convinced it can return good results. I am going to continue to investigate other potential methodologies (e.g. graph clustering) and try to gain a deeper understanding of these methods in order to estimate the quality of results.</p>
