I do not know where I will land after I graduate, but I am excited, energized and inspired by all the women at the Women in Technology event I attended last night.</p>
<p>Held at Palantir Technologies in London, I was blown away by everyone I met: all successful, motivated and passionate developers and entrepreneurs. The original theme of the night was diversity, but the resultant them was doing work you care about, most often towards affecting positive social change.</p>
<p>I wanted to mention at least a few of the people I met, but feel it necessary to mention everyone I met inspired me. Below is just a sample.</p>
<p><strong>Raluca Georgescu:</strong> To use her words, Raluca is in the “alpha phase” of her career as a software engineer. Even though she just graduated her computer science undergraduate course, she has already held an internship at Microsoft, participated in Google’s CodeU and is starting a summer internship with Salesforce.</p>
<p>What’s more is in talking to Raluca, her passion to apply herself to what matters in undeniable. Her final year project is how to improve video streaming over 2G networks to places like sub-Saharan Africa. After meeting Raluca I’m re-thinking what it means to be in tech and make a difference.</p>
<p>Raluca is from Romania and starts her master’s in Data Science at UCL next September.</p>
<p><strong>Hanna Janossy:</strong> Hanna is from Hungary and studied industrial engineering at the University of Toronoto. She comes from 4 generations of female engineers, but has gone far beyond the expectation that she would become another engineer. She has shown incredible initiative her whole life. As one example: As elected president of <em>WISE</em> (Women in Science and Engineering), she increased the annual budget from $500 to $20,000. Her secret? Invite successful women to be keynote speakers at a WISE event; it’s impossible to say no.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Ots:</strong> Katie writes Haskell in the functional programming group at Facebook. ‘Nuff said?</p>
<p>Not quite, Katie is also a “developer community evangelist” and her enthusiasm for functional programming is infectious.</p>
<p>Katie gave us 5 lessons she’s learned over her engineering career and the 2 that most stuck out to me were:</p>
<ol>
<li>We all have diverse backgrounds; emphasize and celebrate what makes you different, that’s also what makes you valuable.</li>
<li>Put yourself first. Don’t feel you have an obligation to “stick it out” if it’s holding you back from what you are truly passionate about.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Evelina Sinkeviciute</strong> Evelina, from Lithuania, studied a masters in innovation, creativity and leadership which led her to found SmartUp.io, an “a smart advice and learning system for early stage entrepreneurs and innovators everywhere.”</p>
<p><strong>Anjana Rajan:</strong> Anjana was founder in one of the first native iPhone applications at 22. The app applied machine learning to recommend new music, achieving a 67% conversion to purchase rate, which is incomparable to the 0.5% conversion rate of the default music discover in the iTunes store at the time. Anjana moved on because she wanted to have a wider social impact and went to work at Johnson &amp; Johnson, as part of the team dedicated to redefining healthcare using technology.</p>
